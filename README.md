Repository contains Python code for image pre-processing and captioning using Deep learning model.
The project baseline i.e. the structure jupyter notebooks, data loaders has been taken from [Udacity Computer Vision ND project](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd891).

Image Dataset (images and captions) - [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
